            <p>TechKart.com launched in 2022, it was with the mission “to be Earth’s most customer-centric company.”<br><br>
                What
                does this mean? It's simple. We're a company that obsesses over our customers. Our actions, goals,
                projects,
                programs and inventions begin and end with the customer top of mind. In other words, we start with the
                customer and work backwards. When we hit on something that is really working for customers, we
                double-down
                on it with hopes to turn it into an even bigger success. However, it’s not always as clean as that.
                Inventing is messy, and over time, it’s certain that we’ll fail at some big bets too.<br><br>

                You'll also hear us say that at TechKart, it's always "Day 1." What do we mean? Our approach remains the
                same as it was on TechKart’s very first day — to make smart, fast decisions, stay nimble, innovate and
                invent, and focus on delighting customers.

                “We continue to aspire to be Earth’s most customer-centric company, and we recognize this to be no small
                or
                easy challenge. We know there is much we can do better, and we find tremendous energy in the many
                challenges
                and opportunities that lie ahead.”</p><br>
